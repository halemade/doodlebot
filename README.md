## But Why?

I came across this project when I was looking for a fun and interactive way to play with gcode. I was curious about building something that could draft patterns for furniture as a sort of segue by which old school furniture humans could understand the value of digital-first product development.

### Building Notes

The support structures for the pen holder are difficult to remove cleanly, going to see if I can modify the file and build in some support structures. The space for the pen is also a little small, based on my marker hunt through my kiddo's art center. Going to see if I can find some of those [skinny Crayola markers](https://www.dickblick.com/products/crayola-fine-line-markers/). It went together pretty easily! The images didn't always agree with the circuit diagrams so after I finish I plan to redraw the circuit and add to this repo.

### Code

The repo included some code to calibrate and test the functionality of the robot. Currently working on an "alphabet" drawing library.
